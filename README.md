# Tulip Hospital: Operational & Financial Analysis (BDM Project - IIT Madras)

##  Summary
This project is a healthcare operational case study of **Tulip Hospital (Sonipat, Haryana)**. It was conducted as part of the Business Data Management course at IIT Madras using real-world data collected across departments between **April 2023 â€“ March 2024**.

##  Objectives
- Optimize procedure attribution to reduce doctor overwork
- Improve documentation standards and billing data entry
- Track monthly trends in OPD/IPD services and occupancy
- Understand financial bottlenecks linked to delayed insurance payments

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset included:
- Monthly OPD and IPD procedures
- Department-wise procedure breakdown
- Billing details by cash, private insurance, and government insurance
- Bed occupancy rates
- Doctor-specific workload metrics
- Patient demographic (Sonipat vs non-Sonipat)

##  Key Results
- **Radiology handled over 18,000 procedures**
- **Cash vs Credit ratio = 29:71**
- Bed occupancy stayed above 80%, peaking at 100% in Feb
- Major reliance on credit led to cash flow issues
- Doctor workloads showed huge imbalance (e.g. 77 vs 2 procedures/day)

##  Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel: data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables, charts
- Metrics: Total Revenue, Bed Occupancy Rate, Doctor Workload, Patient Mix
- Visuals: Bar charts, Line graphs, Pie/Donut charts

##  Recommendations
- Structured doctor attribution: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Referring
- Standardized procedure names (avoid abbreviations)
- Expand temporary capacity in peak months
